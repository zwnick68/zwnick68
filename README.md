**A Musician and Newly Minted Software Engineer??**

Hello! My name is Nicky Zwiren and I am a former content writer and current software engineer. I recently graduated from the in-person software engineering program at the Flatiron School in New York City. At Flatiron I truly cultivated a love for programming, all due to the passion that my instructor and classmates brought to the table. I am currently looking for both frontend and backend work, as I am trying to broaden my horizons with any opportunity that comes my way. 

**Cross - An MMA Mobile Statistics App**

I am currently developing an app titled Cross. Itâ€™s main goal/functionality is to be able to search and compare the statistics between MMA athletes and hopefully all types of combat sports athletes further down the road. I am working towards developing my own API that stores staistics on MMA athletes across all types of promotions around the world. I hope to also implement a news tab so that users can keep on on the latest events and media occurring in the MMA world. Maybe even provide my own predictions with all that data for a fee.. Check out its latest iteration here: [Cross](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BHzM56JVTaf2d96saya13d3HsBIDpCQI/view)
