A Musician and Newly Minted Software Engineer??

Hello! My name is Nicky Zwiren and I am a former content writer and current software engineer. I recently graduated from the in-person software engineering program at the Flatiron School in New York City. It was at Flatiron where I truly cultivated a love for programming, all due to the passion my instructor and cohort mates brought to the table. I am currently looking for both frontend and backend work, as I am trying to broaden my horizons with any opportunity that comes my way. 

Cross - An MMA Mobile Statistics App

I am currently developing a mobile app in react-native titled Cross. Itâ€™s current main goal/functionality is to be able to search and compare the statistics between MMA athletes and hopefully all types of combat sports athletes further down the road. I am working towards developing my own API that stores MMA athletes across all types of promotions around the world. I hope to also implement a news tab so that users can keep on on the latest events and media occurring in the MMA world. Check out its latest iteration here: Cross
